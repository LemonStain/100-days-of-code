# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: November 11, 2020

##### Frontend Mentor Project - Project Tracking Intro Component

**Today's Progress**: Began mobile layout and styling. Next step to finish up text styles and move to laptop style.

**Thoughts:** I feel like there is a better way to do some of the CSS, but I just get it done with whats clicking.
